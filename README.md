# hibernate-insert

This project demonstrates the use of Hibernate ORM in Java to manage various entities such as Animal, Employe, Example, Stud, and Vehicle. Each entity is mapped to a database table using JPA annotations (@Entity, @Id), and Hibernate handles database operations like saving records.

Key Features:

Entities: Includes classes representing real-world entities like animals, employees, students, and vehicles, each with attributes and basic CRUD functionality.

Configuration: Uses hibernate.cfg.xml for database configuration.

Session Management: Manages database transactions using Hibernate's Session and SessionFactory.

Annotation-based Mapping: Leverages JPA annotations for table and column mapping.

Sample Demos: Contains main classes to initialize, save entities, and demonstrate Hibernate integration.
